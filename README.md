## Installation
This project does use Inquirer and Jest throughout so those must be installed in the dependencies section of your package.json then installed using "npm install"

## Usage
To use the logo generator, you must first open your console in the Challenge-10-Logo folder and enter "node index.js". From here you will be prompted to answer a few basic questions about your preferred logo design. If it is all done correctly then you can open your newly generated logo in the logo.svg file by clicking "display with Live Server". This will open a window in your browser, displaying your newly created logo.
